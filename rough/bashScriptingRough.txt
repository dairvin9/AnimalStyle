The basics of a bash scripting.

The first line of a bash script is called a "shebang" or sometimes, a "hashbang". It tells the system which tells the system what to use to run it. Basically, if you write any code in a high level programming language, an interpreter or compiler is needed to run the program. The program that interprets bash is called __bash__. You use this first line to specify where on your computer your copy of the program bash is stored. usually, its in /bin/bash. If you have more than one copy of bash on your computer, you might want to specify which one it will use. If you don't use a shebang, your computer will probably still run the program, by looking in /bin anyway. It is good practice to include this hashbang. Python also uses shebangs, and it is very useful if you have multiple versions of Python on your computer and want to use a specific one. If, upon running your script you get the error: ./script.sh: Command not found, you probably messed up the hashbang.

What is great about bash? All the linux commands you know are actually bash. Like "mkdir favoriteToastRecipes" and "rm *". This means you can just write them into a file and run it as a shell script. For example " echo "say hi to the people"
